                <p>
                    Technology has become an ever-increasing part of our daily lives over the last two to three decades, to the point where it has taken over. Take a break from reading this content and take a look around. What stands out to you the most? Do you notice any
                    technology, such as devices, laptops, or video surveillance? Take note of how electronics and technology devices pervade our life. The computer at your desk, your smartphone next to your bed, your WiFi network, and even your thermostat
                    are all examples of how technology has influenced every aspect of our lives, some for the better and others for the worst. In this blog, I will address the beneficial and negative effects of technology.

                <p>
                    Only a decade ago, cell phones were mostly used for calling and messaging. Cell phones are used for a wide range of activities. Phones can do anything from snap high-resolution images to watching pixel-perfect movies, surfing the web, playing graphic-intensive
                    games, and even tracking your activity. It's astonishing how this small device can perform difficult tasks while yet meeting basic communication requirements.

                <h4 id="adv" style="color: rgb(141, 138, 138); text-decoration: underline;"><b>Negative Impacts of Technology</b></h4>
                <p>
                    While the smartphone revolution has made our lives easier, it has also turned us into couch potatoes. We no longer need to work or move around as much as we used to in order to get things done because the entire world is now at our fingertips. Our dependence
                    on telephones is partly to blame for our sedentary lifestyle and lack of physical activity. This is especially true for the younger generation, who are always glued to their phones. In today's world, cell phone addiction has a significant
                    impact on our lives. Care must be taken in order to adequately solve this problem.

                    Industrial robots, artificial intelligence, and machine learning are examples of emerging technologies that are quickly advancing. These innovations may improve the timeliness, quality, and affordability of goods and services, but they also result in
                    the loss of a large number of jobs. This possibility casts doubt on the traditional benefits model, which binds health care and retirement funds to employment. We must study how to provide benefits to displaced workers in an economy
                    with dramatically fewer workers. If automation makes jobs less secure in the future, a way to deliver benefits outside of the workplace must be found. One concept for giving health care, education, and housing assistance to persons
                    who are not formally employed is "flexicurity," or flexible security.
